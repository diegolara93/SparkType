A MonkeyType like game, but in the terminal. Made using Go. Still not close to done.
Need to add: Most likely a light database like SQLite to save records and maybe a leaderboard, don't want users to have to sign in though as that's a pain for a terminal game. Also more customization for the prompts. Also wpm.
