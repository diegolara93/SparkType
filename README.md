A MonkeyType like game, but in the terminal. Made using Go.

## TODO
Most likely a light-weight database like SQLite to save records and maybe a leaderboard\
Don't want users to have to sign in though as that's a pain for a terminal game, so will most likely default to the USERNAME env variable as a display name.\
Also more customization for the prompts.
